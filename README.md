Main method: Main.java

Title: Payment Statistics Calculator

Scenario:						
You are asked to implement a small Java program that processes a list of Payment objects. Each payment has:
- `id` (String)
- `amount` (BigDecimal)
- `currency` (String)
- `status` (enum: `PENDING`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`)

Requirements:
1. Create the `Payment` class with proper encapsulation and `toString()`.
2. Implement a `PaymentProcessor` class with methods to:
- Add a new payment.
- Retrieve all payments.
- Retrieve payments filtered by status.
- Calculate statistics:
- Total number of payments.
- Total amount of successful payments.
- Average amount of successful payments.
3. Demonstrate usage in a `main()` method:
- Create a few sample payments.
- Process them.
- Print statistics.
4. Bonus (if time allows):
- Sort payments by amount (descending).
- Use Java Streams to implement filtering and statistics.
- Add a simple concurrency simulation: process payments in parallel using `CompletableFuture` or `parallelStream()`.
